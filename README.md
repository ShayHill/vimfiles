A pretty standard medium-weight, Python-focused Vim config.

Most of this config is described in this guide: [Install and Configure Vim in Windows](https://shayallenhill.com/vim-in-windows)

# Requirements:

- a global install of [ripgrep](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ripgrep.mirror/). I downloaded the exe from Sourceforge to `~AppData\Local\Programs`.
- a global install of [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- a subscription to [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- a subscription to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/signup)
- a compiled binary of [gvim_fullscreen](https://github.com/movsb/gvim_fullscreen) in the vimfiles folder
- for markdown preview, a global install of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (extras not required)
- for markdown preview, a global install of yarn (comes with git)
