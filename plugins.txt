Listing packages here so I can add them all at once with
:!python sync_plugins.py  [--replace-all]

- Start looking for packages after encountering the first line that starts
  with #.

- Change the package directory when any line starting with a # has a string
  starting with "pack/". If you change the package directory once, that change
  will persist until the next line starting with a # and containing "pack/".

- Create and run a command f"git submodule add https://github.com/{package}
  {package_directory}/{package_name}" for each package.

- Ignore all lines above the first `^# ... pack/...` line.

- Ignore all lines that start with `"`.
